            <p>The EBA Virtual Fire Panel is built using <strong>Clickteam Fusion Developer 2.5+</strong>. <a href="https://www.clickteam.com" target="_blank">Clickteam Fusion</a> is a game and application development software, and it's easy to use once you learn how it works. There are a ton of user-created extensions, written in C++, that can add additional features to your applications. Fusion can export in a wide variety of types, most notably <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/exe" target="_blank">EXE</a>, <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/apk" target="_blank">APK</a>, <a href="https://fileinfo.com/extension/aab" target="_blank">AAB</a>, and HTML5.</p>
            <p>With the EBA Virtual Fire Panel, the code is grouped into several groups, such as "Main" which stores the code for the app itself, not for the panel. A few important ones:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>"Menu" - Stores the code for the application menus.</li>
                <li>"LED" - Stores the panel's LED coding.</li>
                <li>"Power and Boot" - Controls the panels main boot sequence and power down events.</li>
                <li>"Operation" - Stores all of the code for the panels main operations.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Many of these, such as "Operation", also have several sub-groups. For example, "Operation" has "Screens" to control the displays, and "Button Actions" to control the actions that buttons perform.</p>
            <p>Version 2 of the EBA Fire Panel has 3594 lines of code! Version 1 had 1397 lines, which just shows how much more advanced version 2 is.</p>
