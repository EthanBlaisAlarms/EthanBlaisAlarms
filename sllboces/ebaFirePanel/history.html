            <img src="images/panelV1.png" alt="Version 1 of the EBA Fire Panel, on System Normal screen">
            <p>The EBA Virtual Fire Panel started out as a small panel, with few features. Version 1 originally included Fire, Priority 2, and Supervisory alarms. It also included the following features: Fire Drill, Manual Evac, Point Disable, Selectable Horn Coding, Point Rename, and Protection Suspend.</p>
            <p>The first version continued to be added on to, and features such as History Logs, PA Broadcast, Priority 2 Drill, and Walk Test were added. Eventually, limitations of the first version (such as how the code was written, use of a 40*4 character LCD, etc.) resulted in the creation of Version 2. Version 1 is still available online <a href="https://ethanblaisalarms.com/firepanelonline" target="_blank">here</a>, and no download is required.</p>
            <p>Version 2 is the most recent complete version. It includes all features from version 1, alongside Custom Speaker Sequences, Passcode Protection, Lamp Test, 2 Stages, Read Status, Full Point Customization, Programable Function Keys, and more!</p>
            <p>Eventually, limitations with the back-end of the second version resulted in the creation of a third version. Version 3 is in early development and will include a clean-up and simplification of the code, several new customization options, and multiple profiles.</p>
